Safty Vault is an open source Dropbox alternative that allows you to host your own files instead of relying on a third party.


How To Use
==========


Clone the repo to your server and your client.
Open utils.py and edit connect to the config that suites you.

On the server go int the server directory and run run.py
    python run.py

On the client side go into the client directory and run run.py
    python run.py


All the files that you want to upload will go into the files directory on the client side.



Some notes
==========

There is still some work to do on this but as of right now it is useable, there are some improvements that need to be made that I will get to in the next few releases.
